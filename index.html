    <p>
      Welcome to my world. I am a junior in Computer Science
      at Purdue University, West Lafayette. I am originally from
      India, which is where I have spent most of my life. I 
      enjoy working out, specifically weight lifting, and I recreationally 
      play the guitar. I have always been amazed by the wonder that 
      modern tech is, long before I wrote my first line of code, 
      and that fascination continues to drive me forward.
      <br></br>
      I went to Vasant Valley School for my formative education back
      in India, where I received not only an exceptional academic
      foundation, but also a wholistic development that shaped me 
      as an individual. 
      Now, I am pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at Purdue
      University,minoring in Mathematics and also working
      towards the Certificate in Entrepreneurship and innovation.
      <br></br>
      I am a brother of Delta Mu Kappa, Purdue's Premier Co-ed
      Entrepreneurship and Innovation Fraternity and I am also
      the Treasurer for Purdue Science Student Council. I am 
      currently working as a Resident Assistant at Harrison Hall
      at Purdue, and as a Research Assistant with Professor Sonia Fahmy,
      on an independent study regarding benchmarking of the public cloud.
      I am an AWS Certified Developer - Associate and also a Microsoft 
      Certified Azure Developer Associate.

    <h1>Development Projects</h1>
    <p>
      I wrote my first line of code only days before starting out
      as a freshman at Purdue. I think that being able to apply
      what I learn in class as part of a development project is 
      crucial to the learning cycle. Not only do the core concepts
      get reinforced, but I also learn about tools that can help me
      get to my development goals faster and more efficiently.
      <br></br>
      The best way to  learn a new language or framework, in my
      opinion, is to work with it. In that spirit, I have outlined some of my 
      work below.
    </p>

    <h2>Sorting Visualizer</h2>

      </video>
    </div><p>
    I worked on this project as my first hands-on to any web development.
    I had learnt about various sorting algorithms, among other things, 
    in my Data Structures and Algorithms class. I decided to implement
    a visualizer tool for some common sorting algorithms, while also
    learning web application programming. I allow the user to visualize,
    with distinct cues and speed control, how an algorithm executes
    sorting, while also having a handy count of number of compares and
    swaps made by each algorithm as an objective comparison of performance.
    <br></br>
    I used ReactJS, NPM and Bootstrap to help me develop this application,
    written mostly in JavaScript with CSS for styling. I also learn about
    some eccentricities of JavaScript while debugging.

    <h2>Ping</h2>
    <p>
      
      As a part of my intro to Systems Programming class, I learnt about
      the foundational technologies that are behind the internet. 
      One program essential in debugging web apps or APIs is undoubtedly Ping.
      I tried to replicate the functionality of Ping application that is 
      bundled with almost every shell.
      <br></br>
      The program, written in C, opens a RAW socket and repeatedly sends
      ICMP echo requests to the specified domain. I also added a DNS resolver
      so that the user can enter human-friendly domain names. The user can also
      specify a custom TTL to limit the number of router hops the request has
      to make. The program provides a summary page when execution is stopped by
      the user.
      <a href='https://github.com/avarokins/Ping'>Visit GitHub Repository</a>
      <br></br>
      Having a custom TTL option gave me the idea to implement the functionality
      of traceroute, to give a user the route their request takes to reach
      it's destination, which is one of the projects I am currently working on.

    <h2>Text Frequency Visualizer</h2>

      <video autoplay muted loop>
        <source src="Videos/wordcloud-video.mov" type="video/mp4"></source>
      </video>
    </div><p>
      While browsing the internet I came across this website, that
      had a great visualization of the frequency of words appearing in
      their dataset. I was really impressed by that, and I wanted to
      recreate a similar frequency visualization tool. I had a set of
      articles and I thought to use it to test my implementation. The
      application searches through all the article titles to find topics,
      regions, countries and more categories of interest and displays
      them to the user in a colorful and exciting visualization.
      <br></br>
      This application is made using React Components, NPM and Bootstrap
      with CSS styling. This project really solidified my understanding
      of working with React and Bootstrap. I also worked with 
      React hooks and redux to transfer data across components.

    <h2>TextRecognizer</h2>
    <p>
      I wanted to learn how to make applications for mobile
      platforms, since that is probably the best way to
      reach the largest audience in the modern world. 
      Having never truly tried app development, I decided to
      dip my feet into an easy project and make an Android 
      application to parse text from images.
     <br></br>
      My initial motivation was to be able to edit the text
      in pdf documents, and to do that I used Google's Vision
      API and learnt my way around Android Studio to create an
      application that could do just that. Since working on this
      gave me a hands on experience of developing for Android, I
      am now workin on making a chat application for mobile
      devices.

    <h2>Space Invaders</h2>
    <p>
      This project was my introduction to Python. I wanted
      to teach myself programming in python, so I took it upon
      myself to try and recreate the legacy arcade game, Space Invaders.
      My very rudimentary recreation allows the player to control their
      position to avoid the enemy blocks, and rewards them with a high score.
      <br></br>
      I used the pygame library to draw all the elements of the game.
      This was meant as a primer to Python, and since I have completed
      a course from University of Michigan about Applied Social Network
      Analysis in Python.

      Only being introduced to formally using the 'terminal' program
      two years back, I was taken aback by the productivity and 
      performance of a shell relative to struggling with a GUI.
      I made my custom shell, with functionality similar to 
      bash and ksh.
      <br></br>
      I implemented a custom lexical pattern scanner using lex and 
      grammar using a YACC parser. I implemented he functionality
      of having sub-shells, pipes, i/o redirection, wildcard expressions
      and a whole lot more. I also implemented a custom malloc library
      that my shell uses. I wrote the program in C++.

    <h2>Mystify</h2>
    <p>
      Having gotten some practice using Python, I decided to
      try and recreate one of my favorite Windows screensavers
      from when I was a much younger. I made my own version of
      the legacy Mystify screensaver with customizable colors
      for both the foreground 3D image and the background.
     <br></br>
      I wrote this program using the pygame library in
      Python. Having gotten comfortable with Python, I
      am now working on a handwriting recognizing utility,
      that uses a custom KNN classifier to recognize 
      letters written by a user.
